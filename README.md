# Commitment DOjo

This codebase is contributed to live on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/shipfast/.  We don't know exactly what we're doing, but we will share our process, our thoughts, and our values along the way.  Not wanting to simply hack something together, we will build something practical, with best practices in mind.

## The DOjo app

Want to read a book every day this week, or maybe get yourself to finally go to the gym?  Imagine an app that you and your friends can use to support each other in reaching your goals. Enter the DOjo, a room that binds those who enter together by a shared mission: training to be better. Share in the same goals or create your own.  Encourage each other to succeed with rewards, and punish those who dare fail.

A dojo lasts for 1 weekâ€”complete it and others back-to-back to earn streak bonuses, and compete with your fellow DOjoers.
